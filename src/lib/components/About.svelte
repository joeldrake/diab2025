		<p>Hi,<br />I am a <strong>web developer</strong> from Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
		<p>
			I’ve been building websites since I was young, and in my professional life, it’s always been
			something I’ve gravitated toward. Today, it is my profession.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started out as tech support at a Canadian IT company in 2008. This eventually led to a
			spin-off a few years later into the startup world. Both of these experiences are something I
			draw on today, as a <strong>consultant building a web app</strong> for a major retail company in
			Sweden.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a <strong>passion for open source</strong> in web development. I follow many developers
			and projects in this space and see it as part of my expertise to know and navigate this world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting a new web project in 2025 is an art form. Choosing a suitable tech stack is only step
			one. Next comes laying the foundation for a thoughtful architecture that makes the project
			scalable. After that, it’s about establishing a style guide that keeps the codebase
			maintainable. These are examples of challenges I have extensive experience with and love to
			solve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to <a href="#contact">reach out</a> if you'd like to hear more about my perspective on
			what makes a great web experience, both for end users and developers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Best regards, <br />
			Joel Drake
