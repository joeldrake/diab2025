		<p>I’m a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong> based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
		<p>
			I have been working in tech since 2008. Did some heavy-duty PHP + jQuery back in the day and
			eventually got on the React bandwagon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2019, I’ve been part of a team building a web app for a major retail company in Sweden.
			We use Vue + TypeScript + GraphQL and it has been great to work with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Big fan of open source in web development, in general, and projects like Svelte, Vue, Deno and
			Preact in particular.
		</p>
		<p>I like to be where there are good people and technical innovation.</p>
