		<p>I’m a <strong>Senior Web Developer</strong> based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
		<p>
			I have been working in tech since 2008. Did some PHP + jQuery back in the day and eventually
			got on the React bandwagon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2019, I’ve been part of a team building a web app for a major retail company in Sweden.
			We use Vue + TypeScript + GraphQL, and it's a joy to work with. I consider myself a
			<strong>front-end expert.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Big fan of open source in general, and projects like Svelte, Vue, Deno and Preact in
			particular.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently finding excitement in exploring ways to use AI as a tool to help me and my team ship
			new stuff faster and smarter.
